Overview of "AI":

- Artificial intelligence:
  - defined as: planning, searching, using logic and rules and reasoning
  
  - Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, Google Home
  - AlphaGo, AlphaZero, MarioZero, Deep Blue (beat chess champion)
  - Face recognition (e.g., Facebook), license plates, mailing addresses
  - BMI - brain machine interfaces
  - Cleverbot, help desk phone system, spam calls
  - autonomous vehicles
  - It's a movie

- Machine learning:
  - learning from data to predict in new situations

- Robotics:
  - working with sensors and actuator (motors)
  - some software on board to make it do stuff


Our robot:

- sensors:
  - sonar (ultrasound)
  - photoresistor (light sensor)
  - buttons
  - temperature
  - potentiometer
- actuators:
  - wheel motor
  - servo (360)
- output:
  - lcd
  - speaker
  - led's

The world in terms of robots:

- $100:
  - what's in your hands, a sonar maybe, an arduino
- $1000:
  - intel nuc (little pc), camera, bigger battery, several sonar, cheap LIDAR, wifi
- $10000:
  - gpu, arms and grabbers
- $100000:
  - ROS: robot operating system
- more?
  - walks up stairs, jumps, etc.
